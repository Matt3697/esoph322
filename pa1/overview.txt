Matthew:
	- One thing that gave me trouble was trying to get the x, y, and z components of vectors, without using get methods, for the JUnit test case.
	- Wrote the methods: scale(), add(), negate(), and dot().
	- Wrote the testcases for: scale(), add(), and negate(). 
	- Total time spent on project ~120 mintues. 

James:

Hugh:
	- Fixed variables in dot() and 
	- Wrote junit cases for: magnitude, dot, subtract, and equals
	- Using eGit was troublesome, finally figured it out, then when commiting while another person was,
	  had issues trying to fix commiting and pulling after.
	- Coding took around 10 minutes, figuring out git took around 2 hours
Cory:
	- Wrote methods for magnitude, toString and equals
	- Fixed errors in subtract method and general typos throughout the document
	- Similar issues as team mates with eGit, however was able to understand after working through with Hugh 
	  to learn how to properly pull git projects and updates to eclipse, and commit back in a streamlined manner
	- Learning eGit was the majority of my time commitment, probably an hour and a half to two hours
	  the code itself took me about half an hour
